# Oracle CPP Projects
   
   These applications were written for DBS211 and DBS311. The 311 project has some code removed, as it was written by a groupmember. All other code was written by myself. 
   The purpose of these applications is to use Oracle's instant client to connect to Seneca's Oracle database and perform operations with the data retrieved from it. DBS311 is similar to DBS211 but also works with procedures.
